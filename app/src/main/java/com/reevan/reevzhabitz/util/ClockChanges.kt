/**
 * Emits once immediately, then every time the system clock, time zone or date is changed out from
 * under the app.
 *
 * [TodayClock.tickAtMidnight] sleeps with a coroutine delay, which counts elapsed time — it can't
 * see the wall clock jump. Without this, setting the time, crossing a time zone or a network time
 * correction while the app is open would leave "today" stale until the next restart (seen on the
 * emulator: clock set to 23:59:30, and at 00:00 Home still showed the old date).
 *
 * The receiver is registered only while collected, i.e. while the app is on screen. These are
 * system broadcasts, which reach a not-exported receiver.
