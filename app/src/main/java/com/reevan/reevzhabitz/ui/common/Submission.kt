/**
 * Tracks one-shot submissions — Create, Save, Remove — by token, in the (activity-scoped)
 * ViewModel that performs them.
 *
 * Why not just call the screen back when the write finishes: the ViewModel outlives a rotation,
 * the screen's composition does not. A callback captured before a rotation lands on the old,
 * discarded composition, so the new screen never closes — and with its in-progress flag reset,
 * Create could be tapped again and add the habit twice. Recording "token done" here instead lets
 * whichever composition is on screen *now* see it and act.
 *
 * Backed by Compose snapshot state, so a write from the click handler is visible to the very next
 * read in composition, with no gap where the token looks unknown.
