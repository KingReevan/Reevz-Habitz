/**
 * Lets the screen on top hold up the user leaving it — so the Edit Habit editor can ask
 * "Discard changes?" first.
 *
 * Every way of leaving goes through here — system back, the header's arrow and a tapped
 * breadcrumb — each carrying the back stack the user is heading for. A screen that intercepts
 * keeps that target and, once the user agrees, navigates to exactly it: tapping "Home" with
 * unsaved edits ends on Home after Discard, not one screen back.
 *
 * Screens finishing their own job (Create, Save, Remove) do not go through the guard; they have
 * nothing to lose and use [popIfCurrent].
